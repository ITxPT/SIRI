## Getting Started üöÄ
### Main Root Schemas

**siri.xsd**

- Defines the SIRI XML model elements and attributes that are used to exchange public transport information.
- Supports both request/response and publish/subscribe communication patterns.
- Used by a wide range of public transport operators and service providers.

**siri_all_functionalServices.xsd**

- Imports all of the SIRI functional service schemas.
- Provides a convenient way to access all of the SIRI functionality in a single schema.
- Can be used to develop applications that support all SIRI services.

**siriSg.xsd**

- Defines supplementary SIRI XML model elements and attributes that are used by some SIRI services.
- For example, the siriSg.xsd schema defines elements for exchanging vehicle location and status information, as well as stop monitoring information.
- Can be used to develop applications that support advanced SIRI features.
